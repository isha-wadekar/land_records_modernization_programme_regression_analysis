Analysis of Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme

The Government of India has been digitizing the land records in its villages as part of its Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme under the Depart-
ment of Land Resources within the Ministry of Rural Development. The dataset dilrpmp.xlsx  provide some details of the exist-
ing status of the program for each state (accessed and compiled for the DILRMP website). The variable map_total gives the total number cadastral maps, and
map_goodcondition and map_digitized give the number of maps in good condition and are digitized, respectively. total_ villages is the total number of villages in a
state, CLR_completed is the number of villages with computerization of land records completed. CLR_allocation and survey_ allocation are financial allocations (in
lakhs of rupees) by the central government to the states for computerization of land records and for physical surveying of villages, respectively. (There are allocations for other purposes as well, that I have omitted.) 

We wish to check whether the states that have a better governance record in other domains of the economy are also more ahead in implementing the process of formalization of land records. To test this we use another dataset ggi2019.xlsx (uploaded in Google Classroom) which provide an index of good governance for each state of India. It comes from the Good Governance Index 2019 report of the Department of Administration Reform and Public Grievances (DARPG), Government of India. (You can download the report here.) The composite_points variable gives the overall governance score, while infra_points and econ_points give the scores for two (out of several) components that go into the preparation of the overall score - namely, public infrastructure and economic governance, respectively. Public
infrastructure score measures a state’s progress in provision of potable water, toilets, roads, and power. Economic governance captures a state’s growth in income per
capita, fiscal deficit, share of own revenue, and debt to GSDP ratio.
